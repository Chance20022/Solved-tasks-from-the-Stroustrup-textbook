2)Suppose we define the median of a sequence as "a number with respect to which exactly half 
of the elements are less and the other more." 
Correct the program so that it always displays the median. 
Hint: the median is not always an element of the sequence.

3)Read a sequence of doubles into a vector. 
We assume that each value represents the distance between two cities located on a particular route. 
Calculate and print the smallest and largest distance between two neighboring cities.

4)Write a program that guesses the conceived number from 1 to 100 in 7 steps.

5) Write a program that performs the simple functions of a calculator. 
(+ - * :). Also, there must be floating point numbers. 
The program should offer to introduce three arguments with which it will work in the future.

6)Create a vector that stores ten string values ??"zero", "one" ... "nine". 
Use it in a program that converts a digit into the corresponding string representation: 
for example, when you enter the number 7, seven was displayed on the screen. 
And vice versa, when you enter the number seven, 7 was displayed.

7)Modify the mini-calculator described in Exercise 5 so that it accepts the input of the 
numbers written in both numeric and string format.

8)1 cell = 1 grain, 2 cell = 2 grains, 3 cell = 4 grains, 4 cell = 8 grains. 
With each subsequent cell, the previous number of grains is multiplied by 2. 
Display on the screen how many cells are needed at 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 grains
