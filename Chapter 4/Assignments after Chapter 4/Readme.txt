2)Suppose we define the median of a sequence as "a number with respect to which exactly half 
of the elements are less and the other more." 
Correct the program so that it always displays the median. 
Hint: the median is not always an element of the sequence.

3)Read a sequence of doubles into a vector. 
We assume that each value represents the distance between two cities located on a particular route. 
Calculate and print the smallest and largest distance between two neighboring cities.

4)Write a program that guesses the conceived number from 1 to 100 in 7 steps.

5) Write a program that performs the simple functions of a calculator. 
(+ - * :). Also, there must be floating point numbers. 
The program should offer to introduce three arguments with which it will work in the future.

6)Create a vector that stores ten string values ??"zero", "one" ... "nine". 
Use it in a program that converts a digit into the corresponding string representation: 
for example, when you enter the number 7, seven was displayed on the screen. 
And vice versa, when you enter the number seven, 7 was displayed.

7)Modify the mini-calculator described in Exercise 5 so that it accepts the input of the 
numbers written in both numeric and string format.

8)1 cell = 1 grain, 2 cell = 2 grains, 3 cell = 4 grains, 4 cell = 8 grains. 
With each subsequent cell, the previous number of grains is multiplied by 2. 
Display on the screen how many cells are needed at 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 grains

10)Write the program "Stone, scissors, paper." The machine should give random answers. 
Do not let the user immediately unravel your logic

11-12) Write a program that finds all primes in ascending order. 
The range of finding prime numbers the user must specify

16) In the tasks, you were asked to write a program that would determine the largest and 
smallest number in it for a certain number of numbers. 
The numbers that are repeated a number of times are called a mode. 
Write a program that defines the fashion of a set of numbers

17) I did not because of laziness

18) Write a program to solve quadratic equations through an equation. 
For input, use variables of type double. Since the quadratic equation has two roots, 
write both values in x1 and x2

19-20)Write a program in which the student’s name is entered and then his test scores (Joe 17). 
Stopping the entry by writing NoName 0. Make sure that each name is unique and display an 
error message if there is a name entered twice. Print all students and their points.

After all, change the program. so that when you enter the name, it displays the corresponding 
points, or the error "name not found"

21) Lazy
